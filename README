Run the program with active_sports_stats.py. That should allow the user to make
an inquiry about a skier and/or enter a new skier.

Hard Mode is implemented and includes:
-- Ability to update existing data. After looking up a skier, the user is given
the chance to update the team country name.
-- Ability to sort top skiers by age, in descending order.

ski_stats is the original data file.

sports_stats_migration.py is the file used to read the original data into the
database.
